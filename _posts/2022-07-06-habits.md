Recently I picked up the book Atomic Habits by James Clear and found that it has given me a new look at the way I live my life. I have broken down my learnings from the book and put them in sections down below for others to use as a quick guide to habits if they don't have time to read the book or even to use as another interpretation of the book compared to your own.
