Recently I picked up the book Atomic Habits by James Clear and found that it has given me a new look at the way I live my life. I have broken down my learnings from the book and put them in sections down below for others to use as a quick guide to habits if they don't have time to read the book or even to use as another interpretation of the book compared to your own.

Why habits?
======
Habits are key parts of our lives regardless of whether they are good or bad. The purpose of habits is to conserve energy used on tasks that we do all the time. As we have evolved throughout the course of history, our bodies and minds have come to the realization that we should conserve energy whenever possible and some tasks that we do are always guaranteed to bring us satisfaction so we should do them more often. The more things that we can turn into a habit that we just do without having to think about and make decisions upon, the more time we will have back during our days.

You can have many headings

Aren't headings cool?
