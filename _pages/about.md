Welcome to my personal website!

My Background and History
======
I received my B.S. from the UC-Irvine School of Information and Computer Science. I have worked for Costco and Gatehouse where I raised my customer service skills to a new level. I also have worked at Retirement Benefits Group, where I got a real taste for working in a professional office setting and coordinated goals and progress with supervisors. I have participated in multiple sports and many teams throughout my life. I played baseball, football, and basketball growing up which has helped me to become a great teammate and often times a leader that others can depend on. To keep my competitive side occupied throughout college, I have participated in eSports teams for both CSGO and Valorant. Along with that, I played in a Softball league with my friends.

For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks).
